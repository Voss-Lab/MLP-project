# MLP-Project

This repository serves as the central hub for a machine learning potentials (MLP) project, integrating customized versions of MACE and ASE along with a comprehensive suite of utility scripts for data generation, training, active learning, and analysis. The atomic structures used for training are also included as .xyz files for transparency and reproducibility.
