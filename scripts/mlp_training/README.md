# MLP Training

This directory contains resources related to the training of NN-based machine learning potentials. It is organized into two subdirectories corresponding to different model architectures:

# 1. `ANN-aenet`

- Files related to training the initial Artificial Neural Network (ANN) potential using the aenet framework.
- A subdirectory for post-training analysis of model errors and performance metrics.

# 2. `MPNN-MACE`

- Example input file for training the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) potential using the MACE package.
