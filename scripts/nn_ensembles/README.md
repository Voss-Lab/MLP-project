# Neural Network Ensembles

Scripts for analyzing errorâ€“uncertainty correlations in ensemble models.

- `ANN`: Error-uncertainty analysis for ANN ensembles (Figure 3)  
- `MPNN`: Same analysis for MPNN ensembles (Figures S1, S2)

These support uncertainty quantification and active learning decisions.
