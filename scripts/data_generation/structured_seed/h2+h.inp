"""
This script generates a simulation box populated with molecular and atomic hydrogen.
It outputs the final structure to a PDB file named `out.pdb`.
Additionally, a buffer zone of 10 Å is added around the box.

Prerequisites:
- Ensure Packmol is installed on your system. Please cite the following reference if the Packmol package was used:
L. Martínez, R. Andrade, E. G. Birgin, J. M. Martínez. Packmol: A package for building initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations. Journal of Computational Chemistry, 30(13):2157-2164, 2009.
- Place the 'h2_box.pdb' and 'h_box.pdb' files (containing respective atomic coordinates) in the same directory as this script.

To run this script with Packmol, save it as 'h2.inp' and use the following command:
packmol < h2+h.inp

Output:
- A PDB file named 'out.pdb' containing the final molecular configuration.
